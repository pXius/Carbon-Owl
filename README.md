# Carbon Owl
VSCode dark and light theme optimized for use with ReactJS and other JS frameworks.

Like most, Carbon Owl draws inspiration from other themes, however, it focuses on improved highlighting. Making it easier to identify variables, components, objects, etc.  

Even though ReactJS was the focus point of the highlighting design, the cohesion between JS frameworks keeps the highlighting valid across other frameworks, ie. Angular, Vue, etc.
