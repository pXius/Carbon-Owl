# Carbon Owl
A VSCode dark theme optimized for use with ReactJS and other JS frameworks.

Like most, Carbon Owl draws inspiration from other themes, however, it focuses on improved highlighting. Making it easier to identify variables, components, objects, etc.  

Even though ReactJS was the focus point of the highlighting design, the cohesion between JS frameworks keeps the highlighting valid across other frameworks. 

## Incompatibility ⚠️ 
Other highlighting extensions do not play well with Carbon Owl.  
**Babel Javascript** and **Babel ES6/ES7** should NOT be used in conjunction with Carbon Owl. They will break some of the highlighting.  

### Brackets
Considering Carbon Owl already uses a lot of color, brackets are kept white.  Bracket coloring extensions are fully compatible, but might be overwhelming. Your IDE, your call.  

### Bugs
Again, Carbon Owl's highlighting was designed with ReactJS in mind with limited testing on other frameworks. If you find a bug, please open a ticket and use "Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes" to identify the variable/object etc not highlighting as expected.
